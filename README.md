## Installation

Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OMARROCHDANI/OCP_AUTOMATION.git
    
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Create a superuser account:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser

6. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
7. Ensure Redis is installed and running.


8. Start the Celery Worker: 
    ```bash 
    celery -A first_project.celery worker --pool=solo -l info


- Note: Ensure that you have MySQL and Apache running through XAMPP before starting the dev elopment server. The development server will rely on these services for its functionality.
Now, your ProfessionPulse instance is up and running. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access the application.
